# Pixel Perfect E-Commerce Website Using Next.js and Tailwind CSS
This project demonstrates the creation of a pixel-perfect e-commerce website using Next.js and Tailwind CSS. The primary focus is on designing a visually appealing, responsive, and well-structured website, laying out the foundation for a fully functional e-commerce platform.

## Features:
Responsive Design: The website is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring a seamless user experience across different devices (desktop, tablet, and mobile).
Product Grid Layout: A clean, structured grid layout to showcase products in a visually appealing way.
Header and Navigation: A flexible header layout with a logo, navigation links, and action buttons like "Cart" and "Sign In."
Product Pages: Structured product detail pages with space for images, descriptions, and product information.
Footer: A minimal footer containing useful links such as contact, privacy policy, and social media icons.
Pixel-Perfect UI: Every element is styled to ensure alignment, spacing, and proportions are consistent with the design specifications, resulting in a polished, professional look.
## Tech Stack:
Next.js: A React-based framework providing server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) for faster page load times and better SEO.
Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid and customizable styling, making it easy to build a responsive and clean layout without writing custom CSS.
React: For creating reusable UI components and managing state.
Responsive Layout: Utilizes Tailwindâ€™s responsive utilities for creating layouts that adapt to various screen sizes.
## Pages and Components:
Home Page: Displays featured products and categories in a responsive grid layout. This page is the entry point of the website.
Product Pages: Detailed pages for each product, featuring a description, price, and image (static for now).
Cart Page: A page to view the products added to the cart (structure laid out, but functionality not yet implemented).
Header: A navigation bar that remains fixed at the top, providing links to key sections of the site.
Footer: A minimal footer section containing contact details, social media links, and legal information.
## Project Structure:
/pages: Contains the main pages such as Home, Product, Cart, and others.
/components: Reusable components like Header, Footer, and ProductCard.
/public: Contains static files like images, icons, and other assets used across the site.
/styles: Global styling for the website, managed with Tailwind CSS.
